# Incorporate m2build (grunt handling) into app?
# Include a manual in addition to (or instead of) '--help': https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#man
# Include -v to print version -- require('./package.json').version
# Commands registry should include a description of the command, along with examples / argument options
## When user uses the -help command, loop through the commands and show the command + description values
# Give a description to each module so that it can be shown on the -help output

# Long Term:
## Allow grouping & ordering of commands, so that they're shown under separate headings
