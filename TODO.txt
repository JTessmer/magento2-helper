#	Include a manual in addition to (or instead of) '--help':
	https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#man

#	helpers/config.js -- Load config file at startup, then update get()
	and/or readConfigData() so that they only make a single disk read
	of the config file data

#	Add commands to set user configuration; defaults to current working
	directory; '-g' for global

#	Add coloring to help commands

#	helpers/appMsg.js -- Consider using 'chalk' library for coloring

#	Look for a .m2h-config file in the current working directory; allow
	it to set a local override of configuration settings (i.e. default theme)

#	Add toggle functionality for Template Hints enable/disable

#	Add instructions to README on how to add a module extension

#	Create ~/m2helper; move config file there; allow users to add modules to this folder
